<h2>Motivation</h2>
<p>
For quite a while, I have been giving free haircuts to people around me as my sidekick. It started out as cutting my own hair back in college dorm, but over time, it grew into a monthly thing where I was giving free haircuts to more than 10 people. (Never had I expected that I’ll be giving hair cut to a pastor at my local church back then).

It reached a point where scheduling and managing a haircut session
with every individual became a hassle, and I needed an appointment booking system to communicate my availability to my clients more effectively. I decided to create my own scheduling app - NomadHair. Of course, scheduling solutions like Google Calendar were already available, but I wanted to create a more personalized service as a brand.
