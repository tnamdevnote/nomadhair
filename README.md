<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

![image](https://github.com/tnamdevnote/nomadhair/assets/44216709/09d0d6b3-f00a-4c1f-8444-6ff645d76184)


### What is NomadHair?

NomadHair is a men's haircut service that is delivered to your place.</br>
Sign up, book your appointment, and enjoy the quality haircut without having to leaving your home.

For quite a while, I have been giving free haircuts to my friends and family as my side gig. As my little side gig started growing, figuring out a good time for everyone started becoming a bit of a headache. I knew I needed to find more effective way to let folks know when I was free. That is where NomadHair comes in.

### Motivations

There are two goals I wanted to achieve through this project:
* To launch my personal haircut service as a brand.
* To investigate how component-driven development (CDD) can solve complexities that arise in UI development, potentially leading to a more uniform user experience and design across the product.

To learn more about how I built this project, check out folowing articles & docs:
#### How I Built NomadHair
1. Planning and Design Process - coming soon.
2. Product Development - coming soon.
3. Deployment - coming soon.

# NomadHair

### Bringing Style to your place!



<h2>Motivation</h2>
<p>
There were two motivations behind this project:
<br>
<br>
1. To communicate my availability to my friends and family more effectively, so that they can easily schedule haircut appointment with me.
<br>
<br>
2. To Investigate how a component-driven development can efficiently manage complexities that arise in UI development, potentially leading to a more uniform user experience and design across the product.
