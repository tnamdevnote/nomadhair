<h2>Motivation</h2>
<p>
There were two motivations behind this project:
<br>
<br>
1. To communicate my availability to my friends and family more effectively, so that they can easily schedule haircut appointment with me.
<br>
<br>
2. To Investigate how a component-driven development can efficiently manage complexities that arise in UI development, potentially leading to a more uniform user experience and design across the product.

### Planning and Design Process
#### Establishing brand identity
I started out by defining a system that can help me make design decision more quickly. Rather than including all elements from the start, I focused on the key elements such as color scheme, typography, and logo. This not only prevented me from getting lost in limitless poof of colors and font sizes, but also made it much easier to ensure consistency in overall UI as the design evolved.
