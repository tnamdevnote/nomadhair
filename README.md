<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

![image](https://github.com/tnamdevnote/nomadhair/assets/44216709/7a00dc7a-372e-4030-a0c4-73f58a8de38b)

### What is NomadHair?

NomadHair is a men's haircut service that is delivered to your place.</br>
Sign up, book your appointment, and enjoy the quality haircut without having to leaving your home.

### Why?
I have been giving free haircuts to my friends and family for almost 5 years. It started as a hobby during my college years, but over time it became a monthly work - never had I expected that I would be giving a haircut to a pastor at my local church back then ðŸ˜…. As more people came to me for a haircut, figuring out a good time for everyone started becoming a bit of a headache. I knew I needed to find a more effective way to let them know when I was free. This is where NomadHair comes in.

### Goals
There are two goals I wanted to achieve through this project:
1. To launch my personal haircut service as a brand.
2. To build a web application in component-driven development (CDD) approach to investigate how CDD can solve complexities that arise in UI development, potentially leading to more consistent design and user experience across the product.

If you would like to learn more about how I built this project, check out following articles & docs:
